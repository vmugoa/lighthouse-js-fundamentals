/*
CHALLENGE:
We will be writing a program that prints the numbers from 100 to 200 to the console, with three exceptions:

- If the number is a multiple of 3, print the string "Loopy" instead of the number.
- If the number is a multiple of 4, print the string "Lighthouse" instead of the number.
- If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 4, print the string "LoopyLighthouse" instead of the number.
- By print, we are referring to console.log.
*/


var x = 100

while (x<=200) {
  if (x % 3 === 0 && x % 4 === 0) {
    console.log("LoopyLighthouse");
}else if (x % 3 === 0) {
    console.log("Loopy");
}else if (x % 4 === 0) {
    console.log("Lighthouse");
}
else {
    console.log(x);
}
x = x + 1 ; 
}
